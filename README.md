# Present
Let's face it, a lot of presentations consist of a title slide and a few slides with bullet points. But tools like PowerPoint have a ton of other features and power that can get in the way and make life unnecessarily complicated for a large number of people, so Present aims to simply this by enabling the user to quickly choose from default slide types and add their content.

Please note: the export feature may only work as intended in Google Chrome or Chromium-based browsers.
